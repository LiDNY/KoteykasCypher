Here's some info on this:

I made this while being bored, so don't expect updates/bugfixes

it uses these 4 emoticons to encode it: :3, :P, :D and :O

How it works:

it just finds a symbol in the js corresponding to the ones u wrote, if you want to add more symbols either:

1. Download it [here](https://github.com/SonicPikaLiDNY/KoteykasCypher/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and change the js

2. Fork this repo and change it in ur repo
