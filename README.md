# Don't bother reading this if u just want to encode/decode it, Just go [Here](https://sonicpikalidny.github.io/KoteykasCypher) and use it

# Some things to note:

I made this while being bored, so don't expect updates/bugfixes

it uses these 4 emoticons to encode it: :3, :P, :D and :O

# How it works:

it just finds a symbol in the js corresponding to the ones u wrote, really simple, meaning its easy to add more languages, symbols and other stuff

# Helping to add more symbols:

if you want to add more symbols either:

1. Download it [here](https://github.com/SonicPikaLiDNY/KoteykasCypher/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and change the js

2. Fork this repo and change it in ur repo

3. Download the [.js file](https://github.com/SonicPikaLiDNY/KoteykasCypher/blob/main/script.js) and change it on ur device, then, send it to my [discord](https://dsc.gg/lidny) and i will add it to the website and credit you
